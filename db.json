The Challenge is an annual event that aims to create awareness and mobilize resources for the restoration of key water catchment areas in Kenya to improve the livelihoods and resilience to climate change among forest adjacent communities as well as enhance the survival of wildlife. This year’s theme is Reforest for a Resilient Future.\n\nLaunched in 2014, this event provides participants with a unique opportunity to connect with nature, engage in an exhilarating experience, and contribute to the worthy cause of forest conservation. Kenya’s major water catchment areas continue to be degraded at an alarming rate through deforestation and distractive human activities. This has escalated the impacts of climate change and loss of biodiversity. This initiative seeks to counter this harmful trend through raising awareness and forest restoration.",
